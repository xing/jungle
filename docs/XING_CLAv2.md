# XING Contributor License Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions
from any person or entity, the Company must have a Contributor License Agreement
("CLA") on file that has been accepted by each Contributor, indicating agreement
to the license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection
of the Company and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own
Contributions for any other purpose.

1. **Definitions**. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal
   entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with
   the Company. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is
   intentionally submitted by You to the Company for inclusion in, or
   documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Company (the
   "Work").

2. **Grant of Copyright License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to recipients of software
   distributed by the Company a perpetual, worldwide, non- exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
   works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works.

3. **Grant of Patent License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to recipients of software
   distributed by the Company a perpetual, worldwide, non- exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
   sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
   applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
   infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
   Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If
   your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create that
   includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission
   to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has
   waived such rights for your Contributions to the Company, or that your
   employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Company.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You
   represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any
   third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
   related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which
   are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
   extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
   fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
   without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. You agree to notify the Company of any facts or circumstances of which you
   become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
